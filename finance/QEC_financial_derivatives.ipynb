        "1. Encoding Logical Qubit using Shor Code: This part of the circuit encodes a single logical qubit into nine physical qubits using the Shor code to protect against errors. \\\\\n",
        "  **Purpose:** This encoding protects the logical qubit from single-qubit bit-flip and phase-flip errors.  \\\\\n",
        "  (a) **Hadamard Gates:** Creates a superposition of |0⟩ and |1⟩ states for each of the first three qubits. \\\\\n",
        "  (b) **CNOT Gates:** Copies the state of the first qubit in each group of three to the other two qubits in the group, forming triplets. \\\\\n",
        "  (c) **CNOT Gates (Second Stage):** Creates entanglement between the triplets, encoding the logical qubit across the nine physical qubits.\n",

        "2. Applying Quantum Operations for Derivative Pricing: This part of the circuit applies a placeholder series of Hadamard gates for demonstration purposes, representing the quantum operations needed for derivative pricing. \\\\\n",

        "  **Purpose:** To detect and identify the location of errors in the encoded qubits. \\\\\n",
        "  (a) **Bit-Flip Syndrome Measurement:** Uses CNOT gates to entangle the encoded qubits with the ancillary qubits, which are then measured to detect bit-flip errors. \\\\\n",
        "  (b) **Phase-Flip Syndrome Measurement:** Uses Hadamard gates and CNOT gates to detect phase-flip errors by transforming them into bit-flip errors, which are then measured using the ancillary qubits. \\\\\n",
        "  **Purpose:** To correct any detected errors, ensuring the integrity of the encoded logical qubit is maintained. \\\\\n",
        "  (c) **Bit-Flip Error Correction:** Uses the information from the ancillary qubits to apply corrective CNOT gates to the encoded qubits, fixing bit-flip errors. \\\\\n",
        "  (d) **Phase-Flip Error Correction:** Uses Hadamard gates to transform phase-flip errors into bit-flip errors and then corrects them using CNOT gates.\n"
