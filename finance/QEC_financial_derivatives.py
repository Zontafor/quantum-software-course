# Encoding Logical Qubit using Shor Code: This part of the circuit encodes a single logical
# qubit into nine physical qubits using the Shor code to protect against errors.
#   Purpose: This encoding protects the logical qubit from single-qubit bit-flip and phase-flip errors.
#       (a) Hadamard Gates: Creates a superposition of |0⟩ and |1⟩ states for each of the first three qubits.
#       (b) CNOT Gates: Copies the state of the first qubit in each group of three to the other two qubits in
#           the group, forming triplets.
#       (c) CNOT Gates (Second Stage): Creates entanglement between the triplets, encoding the logical qubit
#           across the nine physical qubits.
#
#
# Applying Quantum Operations for Derivative Pricing: This part of the circuit applies a placeholder series
# of Hadamard gates for demonstration purposes, representing the quantum operations needed for derivative pricing.
#   Purpose: This is a placeholder for more complex quantum operations that would be used in a real derivative
#   pricing algorithm. For example, this could include amplitude estimation or other quantum algorithms specific
#   to financial modeling.
#       (a) Hadamard Gates: Applies Hadamard gates to all qubits, creating a superposition of all possible states.
#
# Measuring Syndromes and Correcting Errors: This part of the circuit measures the syndromes for error detection
# and applies corrections to maintain the integrity of the encoded logical qubit.
#   Purpose: To detect and identify the location of errors in the encoded qubits.
#       (a) Bit-Flip Syndrome Measurement: Uses CNOT gates to entangle the encoded qubits with the ancillary
#           qubits, which are then measured to detect bit-flip errors.
#       (b) Phase-Flip Syndrome Measurement: Uses Hadamard gates and CNOT gates to detect phase-flip errors by
#           transforming them into bit-flip errors, which are then measured using the ancillary qubits.
#   Purpose: To correct any detected errors, ensuring the integrity of the encoded logical qubit is maintained.
#       (c) Bit-Flip Error Correction: Uses the information from the ancillary qubits to apply corrective CNOT
#           gates to the encoded qubits, fixing bit-flip errors.
#       (d) Phase-Flip Error Correction: Uses Hadamard gates to transform phase-flip errors into bit-flip errors
#           and then corrects them using CNOT gates.
